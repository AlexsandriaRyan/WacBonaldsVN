## Goal
- Learn a language over the course of the semester.
- Create a final project that shows your language learning.

## Process
In picking a language to learn, I also considered what I'd like my final project to be. Because Python is a popular language, and I am interested in creating some kind of game, I decided to learn Python. More specifically, I decided to learn Python via Ren'Py, a visual novel software.
To learn the basics of Python, I picked up a few LinkedIn Learning courses, then moved onto Ren'Py-specific tutorials.
The game itself included plenty of dialogue (it is a visual novel, after all), so to add a little challenge, I added flags throughout the game that will unlock certain scenes, dialogue, options, and game endings.

## Reflection
I definitely learned a lot about the world of Ren'Py. There is an extremely resourceful community. Needless to say, I've never used more Reddit than StackOverflow for a project in my life until now. There is lots to learn about Python, but I think Ren'Py was a creative way to explore it.
